"""xgen_rsi.base.host — host-agnostic agent-turn executor.

Extracted from ``agent_geny.AgentGenyNode.execute`` so every entry point runs
the SAME turn logic and can never diverge. The host supplies infrastructure
through :class:`HostServices`; the executor supplies the (identical)
orchestration.

This layer lives INSIDE the runtime (not a separate package): the engine core
stays pure, and this submodule holds the turn orchestration + the ``HostServices``
protocol the host implements. ``ServerHostServices`` lives in xgen-workflow.
Every module here is import-clean of xgen-workflow — the product coupling is
injected via the host.
