"""Pluggable tool source abstraction.

Cycle 20260424 executor uplift — Phase 3 Week 7.

The :class:`~xgen_rsi.base.tools.providers.AdhocToolProvider` already
exists for *name-keyed lookup*: the manifest declares
``tools.external = ["foo", "bar"]`` and the pipeline asks each adhoc
provider whether it supplies a tool for each requested name. Useful
when hosts want the manifest to stay authoritative.

This module adds the complementary pattern: **self-contained bundles**.
A :class:`ToolProvider` declares its own name, owns its lifecycle, and
exposes the complete set of tools it ships via :meth:`list_tools`.
Hosts compose a pipeline by handing several providers into
:meth:`Pipeline.from_manifest_async` — think of each provider as a
"feature pack" the host decides to enable wholesale.

Two shipped implementations:

* :class:`BuiltInToolProvider` — wraps the executor's built-in
  catalogue (:data:`~xgen_rsi.base.tools.built_in.BUILT_IN_TOOL_CLASSES`)
  with optional feature-gated subset selection.
* Hosts can subclass :class:`ToolProvider` directly for their
  platform-specific tools (e.g. Geny's creature / feed / knowledge
  tools arrive through a ``GenyPlatformToolProvider``).

Unlike :class:`AdhocToolProvider`, the manifest does **not** need to
list the tool names ahead of time — the provider owns the roster, and
the host's decision to wire the provider in IS the opt-in. This fits
the "xgen-agent-runtime first" principle: hosts import and configure
providers rather than enumerating tool names.

See ``executor_uplift/06_design_tool_system.md`` §8 and
``executor_uplift/12_detailed_plan.md`` §3 (Week 7 Provider Protocol).
