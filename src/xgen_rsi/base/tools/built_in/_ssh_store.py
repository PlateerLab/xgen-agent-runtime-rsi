"""Per-session SSH server credential store.

The host hands the user's configured servers to the session via
``ToolContext.extras["ssh"]["servers"]``. **When that key is present it is the
whole truth for the turn** — including when it is an empty list, which is how a
host says "this user turned SSH off / has no servers".

A file at ``<storage_path>/ssh/servers.json`` is only a fallback for a session
with no host injection at all (the executor run standalone). Writing to it is
opt-in (``extras["ssh"]["persist"] = True``) and **off by default**, because the
file holds decrypted credentials at rest for the life of the session directory.
A host that re-injects every turn — which is what makes a rotated password or a
revoked server take effect on the next turn — gains nothing from that file and
would only risk a stale copy outliving the change. So when persistence is off we
also delete any file an earlier version left behind.

The split that keeps secrets away from the agent:

* :meth:`SSHServerStore.list_public` returns only non-secret metadata (name,
  host, port, user, description, auth kind, jump path) — safe to show the model.
* :meth:`SSHServerStore.resolve` returns the FULL record (including password /
  private key), used ONLY inside a tool to open the connection. The agent
  passes a server *name*; it never sees or handles the credential.

:meth:`SSHServerStore.resolve` doubles as the **jump-host resolver** handed to
``_ssh``: a record reached through a bastion names that bastion, and the
connection layer looks it up here. That is why the store is passed down rather
than a single record — a bastion is just another entry, described once.
