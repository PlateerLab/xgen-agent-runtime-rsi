"""EnterPlanMode / ExitPlanMode — toggle restricted-operation flag.

Cycle 20260424 executor uplift — Phase 3 Week 6.

Plan mode is a soft guardrail: while active, the agent should plan
before acting — most hosts wire it to Stage 4 Guard (future) to block
destructive tools and require the LLM to surface a plan first. These
tools don't enforce that themselves; they just flip a well-known flag
on ``state.shared`` so downstream stages / tools can inspect it.

The flag name (``executor.plan_mode``) and its shape (``bool``) are
considered part of the public state contract. Hosts subscribing to the
flag via the Phase 1 permission / guard matrix should look for this
key.

Two tools ship as a pair — the LLM opts in, then opts back out once
the plan is approved or abandoned:

* ``EnterPlanMode({"reason": "..."})`` — sets the flag to ``True`` and
  records the (optional) reason in metadata.
* ``ExitPlanMode({"reason": "..."})`` — clears the flag and records the
  reason.

Both are idempotent: calling Enter twice leaves the state as True;
calling Exit while already off is a no-op with a benign notice.

See ``executor_uplift/06_design_tool_system.md`` §7 and
``executor_uplift/12_detailed_plan.md`` §3 (Week 6 Meta).
