"""Pluggable search backends for the ``WebSearch`` built-in tool.

The default backend remains DuckDuckGo (``ddg``) via the optional
``ddgs`` package, so the legacy WebSearch path is byte-for-byte
unchanged. Hosts that want a different provider can switch backends
without touching the tool surface — selection happens in
:meth:`WebSearchTool.execute` (input param ``backend`` > extras >
``GENY_WEBSEARCH_BACKEND`` env > ``"ddg"``).

Every backend implements the async :class:`WebSearchBackend` protocol
and returns *normalized hits* — the exact shape
:meth:`WebSearchTool._normalise_hit` produces (``rank`` / ``title`` /
``url`` / ``snippet``) — so the tool's formatting + metadata stay
identical regardless of provider.

Non-ddg backends speak HTTP through ``httpx`` (already a hard
dependency, used by ``WebFetch``), so adding them introduces **no new
required packages**. ``ddgs`` stays the optional ``[web]`` extra.

Config / credentials are read from ``ToolContext.extras["web_search"]``
first, then environment variables:

* ``brave``   — ``brave_api_key`` / ``BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY``
* ``tavily``  — ``tavily_api_key`` / ``TAVILY_API_KEY``
* ``searxng`` — ``searxng_url``   / ``SEARXNG_URL``
* ``ddg``     — ``ddg_extra_engines`` / ``GENY_WEBSEARCH_DDG_EXTRA_ENGINES``:
  engines ddgs ships switched off that we run anyway (comma list, default
  ``yandex``; empty turns it off)

When a backend is missing its key/url, it raises
:class:`WebSearchConfigError` with a clear config hint; the tool turns
that into a ``ToolResult(is_error=True)``.
