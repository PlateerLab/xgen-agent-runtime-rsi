"""Skill gateways — the door that actually opens its room.

## The contract

Our tool surface is hierarchical: basic verbs are visible from turn 1, and
everything else sits behind **one door per family** (``JobGuide``,
``AppGuide``, ``SelfExtendGuide``). ``tool_exposure`` states it
plainly — "JobSchedule/JobList/JobCancel 은 이 문 뒤에".

Behind the door only works if opening it *lets you in*. It did not. A guide
returned its map and nothing else, so the family stayed deferred and the only
thing that could actually expose a member was ``ToolSearch`` — which no guide
ever mentions. The result was a surface that contradicted its own instructions:

    JobGuide     ->  "JobSchedule(tool=..., cron_expr=...) — schedule it."
    JobSchedule  ->  Error: No such tool available

The model did exactly what it was told and hit a wall. Worse, the failure is
client-side on CLI backends (Claude Code rejects unknown names locally), so no
amount of server leniency could rescue the call.

So: **calling a guide opens its family.** The guide is the search step for its
own room — ``ToolSearch`` stays what it always was, the way into the long tail
(connected API / DB / MCP nodes, hundreds of schemas nobody should read up
front).

## Why activation lives here and not in each guide

Three guides in three modules doing the same best-effort dance is three places
to forget the ``try``. One helper, one behaviour: never raise, and always say
what opened — a guide that silently fails to open its room is the bug this
module exists to end.

#: Appended to a guide's answer when it just opened its family. The model reads
#: this in the same result that told it which verb to use, so the two halves of

#: together instead of one turn apart.

#: The second sentence is for CLI clients. The bridge tells the CLI that its tool
#: list changed, but the list does not always refresh before the next call
#: (measured 2026-09-24 against the Geny turn-1 surface: Claude Code 2.1.236
#: rejected the just-opened tool with "No such tool available" in 70 of 158 runs,
