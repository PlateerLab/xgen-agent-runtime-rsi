"""Runtime-provided tool protocol.

Host applications often carry their own tool implementations that cannot
round-trip through :class:`~xgen_rsi.base.tools.adhoc.AdhocToolDefinition`
— e.g. Python classes that bind to internal services, have behavior not
expressible as ``http | script | template | composite``, or depend on
per-request context (DB session, per-user auth state, …). Instead of
forcing those into the manifest, the host can hand
:meth:`Pipeline.from_manifest` (or
:meth:`Pipeline.from_manifest_async`) a list of
:class:`AdhocToolProvider` implementations.

The manifest's ``tools.external`` field names which provider-backed
tools are active in a given environment. The pipeline walks
``manifest.tools.external``; for each name the first provider that
returns a :class:`Tool` from :meth:`AdhocToolProvider.get` wins. Names
that no provider claims are skipped silently — same policy as missing
``built_in`` entries, so a partial manifest keeps loading.
