"""Low-level SSH primitives for the built-in SSH tools.

Pure-async, built on ``asyncssh`` (native asyncio — no thread offload, so it
drops straight into a tool's ``async def execute``). Mirrors the shape of
``tools/_sandbox.py``: small helpers that open a connection, run a command (or
transfer a file), and return a ``(rc, stdout, stderr)`` triple, with all output
shaping/truncation left to the caller.

``asyncssh`` is an OPTIONAL dependency (extra ``ssh``). It is imported lazily so
the core install stays lean; callers get :class:`SSHUnavailableError` (a clean
install hint) when it is absent, never an ``ImportError`` at import time.

A "server" here is a plain dict — the credential record resolved by name from
the per-session store (see ``tools/built_in/_ssh_store.py``):

    {"name", "host", "port"?, "user", "password"?, "private_key"?,
     "passphrase"?, "description"?, "strict_host_key"?, "jump"?}

At least one of ``password`` / ``private_key`` must be present. The password
never leaves this module (it is fed to the transport / to ``sudo -S`` on
stdin), so the agent — which only ever passes a server *name* — never handles
it.

Jump hosts (bastions)
---------------------
``jump`` is an ordered list of **other configured server names** — the path
taken to reach this host, nearest hop first::

    {"name": "db", "host": "10.0.0.9", "jump": ["bastion", "inner-gw"]}

We open ``bastion`` first, tunnel ``inner-gw`` through it, then tunnel ``db``
through that. Naming other records (rather than inlining a nested credential)
means one machine is described **once** and can serve as both a bastion and a
target — and a rotated password is changed in one place. Resolution needs the
store, so the entry points take a ``resolver`` callable; without one, a record
that declares ``jump`` is refused rather than silently connected directly (a
direct dial usually fails, but when the bastion's network is flat it could
*succeed* against the wrong path — that must never happen quietly).
