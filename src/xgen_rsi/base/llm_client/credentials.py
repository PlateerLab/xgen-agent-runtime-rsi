"""Provider-credentials bundle — the single channel by which hosts inject
authentication into the executor.

Replaces the legacy ``Pipeline.from_manifest_async(api_key=...)`` single-string
path (kept alive for back-compat in earlier executor versions; removed once
Phase A3 lands).

Design notes
------------

* ``ProviderCredentials`` is provider-shaped: API providers care about
  ``api_key`` (+ optional ``base_url`` / headers), CLI providers care about
  ``binary_path`` plus any extras (workspace_root, MCP config, etc).
* ``CredentialBundle`` is just a ``provider_name → ProviderCredentials`` map
  with two helpers: ``.get`` (soft) and ``.require`` (raises ``ConfigError``).
* ``ProviderCredentials.__repr__`` redacts ``api_key`` so credentials cannot
  leak through logs / event_sink dumps / debug repr.
* No convenience ``from_legacy_api_key`` / ``from_env`` constructors — hosts
  must build the bundle explicitly. Geny owns its own builder
  (``backend/service/settings/credentials.py``).

    """Authentication / configuration for one provider.

    Field semantics:
    - ``api_key``: vendor API key (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google) or "" for
      providers that don't use an API key (vLLM with EMPTY, CLI backends
      that authenticate via subscription).
    - ``auth_mode``: which credential channel the provider should be
      driven through — ``'api_key' | 'oauth' | 'setup_token' | 'auto'``.
      Only CLI backends consume it today (it decides e.g. whether
      ``claude`` runs with ``--bare``); API providers ignore it.
      ``'auto'`` (default) means "infer from the other fields": a
      non-empty ``api_key`` resolves to the API-key path, otherwise the
      subscription/OAuth path. Explicit values exist because inference
      was previously done by sniffing the *spawning process's*
      ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` env var — a variable the scrubbed child env
      never necessarily contained — which broke every subscription user
      the moment an unrelated key was exported (PR #868 history).
      Declaring ``'oauth'`` / ``'setup_token'`` also marks the
      credentials as non-empty: the credential material lives on disk
      (``claude auth`` state), not in this object.
    - ``base_url``: HTTP endpoint override (vLLM, custom Anthropic proxy).
    - ``default_headers``: extra HTTP headers (e.g. Anthropic-Beta).
    - ``binary_path``: CLI backend binary path (claude, gh).
    - ``extras``: provider-specific knobs (workspace_root, mcp_config,
      allow_tools, ...). Each client knows how to read its own keys.
