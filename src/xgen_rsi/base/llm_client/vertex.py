"""Google Vertex AI client (Gemini models on Vertex).

Extends :class:`GoogleClient` — the ``google-genai`` SDK speaks both the
Gemini API and Vertex through the same ``genai.Client``; only the
constructor differs. Request building, response parsing, streaming and
error classification are inherited (``_classify_api_core`` in the parent
was written for exactly the Vertex/grpc error surface).

Authentication (three supported channels, first match wins):

1. ``credentials_json`` — a service-account key JSON string. Parsed with
   ``google.oauth2.service_account`` (``google-auth``); the strictest and
   most portable channel for server deployments.
2. ``api_key`` — Vertex *express mode* API key.
3. Application Default Credentials — nothing passed; the SDK resolves
   ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` / metadata-server identity.

``project`` is required for channels 1 and 3 (express-mode keys carry
their own project binding).
