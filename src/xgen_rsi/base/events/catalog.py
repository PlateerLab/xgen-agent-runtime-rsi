"""EventTypes — the published, versioned catalogue of engine event names.

Why this exists (2.2.0, audit 2026-06-09 §3.2): the event stream was the
de-facto host contract — Geny and GAPT both built their UIs on it — but
the taxonomy lived as untyped string literals scattered across ~40 call
sites. GAPT *guessed* names and shipped a 100%-text-loss bug and a
$0-cost bug off two wrong guesses; Geny maintained two divergent
600-line mapping switches. This module is the single authoritative
enumeration of every event name the engine emits, plus a field-level
payload description per event (:data:`PAYLOADS`).

Contract rules
--------------
* **Values are the wire strings.** ``EventTypes.TEXT_DELTA == "text.delta"``
  — the enum is a *names registry*, not a rename. Existing consumers
  matching raw strings keep working forever.
* **Append-only.** New events may be added in minor releases; renaming
  or removing a member is a major-version change. A member whose
  emitter is removed in a minor release stays in the enum and is listed
  in :data:`RETIRED_EVENT_TYPES` ("no longer emitted") until the next
  major version drops it.
* **Payloads may gain fields** in minor releases; existing fields keep
  their meaning. :data:`PAYLOADS` documents the fields each event
  carries today (descriptions, not strict schemas — events are
  observability, not RPC).
* Completeness is enforced by a grep/AST-driven test
  (``tests/unit/test_event_catalog.py``): every string literal passed
  to ``state.add_event`` / ``Pipeline._emit`` in ``src/`` must appear
  here, so a new emit site cannot ship uncatalogued.

What is deliberately NOT here
-----------------------------
* :class:`~xgen_rsi.base.hooks.events.HookEvent` — the hook taxonomy is
  a separate, already-typed channel (blocking semantics, its own
  ``FIRED_EVENTS`` honesty test). Catalogue events are observational.
* Memory-plane STM journal entries (``MemoryProvider.append_event``)
  — provider-internal persistence, not the pipeline stream.

The ``llm_client.*`` family is included even though it travels through
the client's ``event_sink`` callback rather than ``state.add_event`` —
hosts that wire a sink receive exactly these names, and they were the
other half of the unpublished contract.
