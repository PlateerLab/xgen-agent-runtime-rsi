"""Audio capability layer — model-gated media bridges.

The model's content vocabulary is text/image/document only: there is no
audio block. This package therefore holds the bridges that turn
workspace audio into something the model can consume — starting with
STT (:mod:`xgen_rsi.base.audio.stt`). The tool surface lives in
``tools/built_in/audio_tools.py`` and is hidden behind
``feature:stt_enabled`` until the host wires a provider.
