"""Streaming tool executor — online variant of PartitionExecutor.

Cycle 20260424 executor uplift — Phase 2 Week 4 Checkpoint 1.

``PartitionExecutor`` assumes all pending tool calls arrive in one
batch. ``StreamingToolExecutor`` is the online counterpart: tool calls
are added incrementally (as the LLM streams ``tool_use`` blocks) and
safe tools start executing immediately. When ``drain()`` is called,
the executor waits for all work to complete and returns results in
**received order** (not completion order).

Key invariants:

1. **Receive-order output.** ``drain()`` preserves the index at which
   each call was added. Downstream stages (Tool Review, Agent, Loop)
   see a deterministic sequence regardless of completion timing.
2. **Safe tools run immediately** when the pending queue contains no
   unsafe tools. This maximises overlap with the LLM's streaming
   response — by the time the stream ends, safe tools may already
   be finishing.
3. **Unsafe tools serialise.** A ``concurrency_safe=False`` call blocks
   subsequent calls (safe or unsafe) until it completes. This honours
   the fail-closed default: when ordering / atomicity matters, the
   tool opts out of parallelism and the executor respects the chain.
4. **Bounded parallelism.** ``max_concurrency`` caps the number of
   in-flight safe tools. Extra safe calls wait for a slot.
5. **Fail-closed on missing metadata.** Unknown tool names, missing
   registry, or ``capabilities()`` raising all fall back to unsafe
   treatment (serialize).

See ``executor_uplift/06_design_tool_system.md`` §6 and
``12_detailed_plan.md`` §2.

    Beyond the batch ``ToolExecutor.execute_all`` surface (implemented
    since 2.2.0 review N4, so manifests can elect this executor as
    Stage 10's ``executor`` strategy under the registry name
    ``"streaming"``), this class exposes an ``add(call)`` / ``drain()``
    interface so hosts integrating with streaming LLM responses can
    kick off safe tools while the model is still emitting subsequent
    tool_use blocks.

    Typical usage::

        executor = StreamingToolExecutor(registry=reg, router=router)
        async for tool_use in llm_stream:
            await executor.add(_as_tool_call(tool_use))
        results = await executor.drain(context, on_event=state.add_event)

    When every tool in a turn is concurrency-safe, overlapping with
    the LLM stream can cut end-to-end latency roughly in half for
    read-only parallel searches. When any tool is unsafe, the executor
    degrades gracefully to the serial ordering the tool expected.
