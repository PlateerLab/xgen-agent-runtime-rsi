"""ToolDispatcher — Stage 10's dispatch path, callable from outside Stage 10.

Why this exists (2.3.0): the Stage 6 ``tool_loop="internal"`` strategy
resolves tool calls inside the API stage, CLI-style. Those dispatches
MUST be indistinguishable from Stage 10's own: same
:class:`~xgen_rsi.base.tools.registry.ToolRegistry` instance, same
permission ladder (matrix rules → posture → ASK→HITL → hooks — all owned
by :class:`~xgen_rsi.base.stages.s10_tool.artifact.default.routers.
RegistryRouter`), same large-result persistence and state-mutation
application, same canonical ``tool_result`` dict shape. Re-implementing
any of that inside Stage 6 would create the second permission-decision
path the 2.2.0 audit explicitly forbids.

So the dispatcher is deliberately thin: it holds the live
:class:`ToolStage` instance and, per call, drives the stage's OWN
machinery — ``build_dispatch_context`` (which reads permission rules /
posture / HITL requester off the stage's attached context at call time,
so ``refresh_runtime`` swaps are visible to internal-loop dispatches on
the very next turn) plus a stateless :class:`SequentialExecutor` for the
single-call route. The executor emits the same ``tool.call_start`` /
``tool.call_complete`` events Stage 10 emits, so per-call timing
attribution is identical across both execution shapes.

Lifetime: ``Pipeline._init_state`` installs a dispatcher onto
``state.tool_dispatcher`` whenever a Tool stage is registered — rebuilt
each run (construction is two attribute writes) so stage replacement via
``PipelineMutator`` is picked up at the next turn boundary.
