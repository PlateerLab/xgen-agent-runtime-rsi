"""Apply ``ToolResult.state_mutations`` onto ``PipelineState.shared``.

Cycle 20260424 executor uplift — Phase 3 Week 6.

The Tool ABC has carried a ``state_mutations`` attribute since the
Phase 1 foundation: a dict of proposed updates to ``state.shared`` that
the orchestrator applies on the tool's behalf. Until now the field was
declared but no stage consumed it — this module provides the
application side so tools like ``TodoWrite`` can finally propagate
their view into cross-stage state.

Rules:

* Only applied on **successful** tool calls. ``is_error=True`` results
  skip mutation — a failing tool must not leave its half-written state
  behind.
* Keys must use one of the documented namespaces (``executor.``,
  ``memory.``, ``geny.``, or ``plugin.<ns>.``). Unknown namespaces are
  logged and dropped — we don't want a misspelled key silently
  polluting ``state.shared``.
* Values are shallow-copied into ``state.shared``; callers are
  responsible for avoiding shared-reference aliasing hazards in
  mutable containers they hand over.
* Application is idempotent within a turn — two consecutive tool
  results writing the same key end up with the second value, same as
  plain dict assignment.

See ``executor_uplift/06_design_tool_system.md`` §6 and
``executor_uplift/09_design_extension_interface.md`` §4.
