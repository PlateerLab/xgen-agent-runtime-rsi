"""Tool-loop strategies — where the agentic loop runs (2.3.0).

Why this slot exists: the ``claude_code_cli`` backend runs its agentic
loop INSIDE the subprocess — Stage 6 streams the events, the terminal
:class:`APIResponse` carries only final text (tool_use blocks consumed;
see ``StreamJsonAccumulator.finalize`` in
``llm_client/translators/_cli.py`` for the contract rationale), Stage 9
finds no pending tool calls and Stage 10 naturally no-ops. SDK
providers, by contrast, paid a full pipeline iteration per tool
round-trip: every Stage 2-5/7/14 re-run, per call. This slot makes the
CLI execution shape a manifest-selectable choice for EVERY backend:

- :class:`PipelineToolLoop` (default ``"pipeline"``) — exactly the
  pre-2.3.0 behaviour: one client call, tool_use blocks returned
  verbatim, Stage 9 → Stage 10 → Stage 16 own the loop. Zero behaviour
  change for every existing manifest.
- :class:`InternalAgenticLoop` (``"internal"``) — resolves tool calls
  inside Stage 6 (call → dispatch → call …) and returns only the final
  text/thinking response, mirroring the CLI accumulator's finalize
  contract. Tool dispatch goes through the SAME
  :class:`~xgen_rsi.base.stages.s10_tool.dispatcher.ToolDispatcher`
  channel Stage 10 uses (same ToolRegistry instance, same
  ``evaluate_permission`` matrix path, same PERMISSION_* / PRE/POST
  hook firing) — there is exactly one permission decision
  implementation in the engine, not two.

    blocks: dispatch them through the state-carried
    :class:`~xgen_rsi.base.stages.s10_tool.dispatcher.ToolDispatcher`
    (Stage 10's registry, permission matrix, ASK→HITL ladder and hook
    events — one decision path, shared), append the exchange to a
    LOOP-LOCAL message list, and call the client again with
    ``state.messages + exchange``. ``state.messages`` is mutated only
    once, at loop end: every intermediate assistant tool_use message
    and user tool_result message is recorded in order (completeness
    over thrift — a rehydrated session must replay the same
    conversation the model actually saw), and the FINAL assistant
    content still lands via the stage's normal append — the same
    contract as the single-call path.

    The returned :class:`APIResponse` carries only final text/thinking
    blocks: the loop only exits successfully when the model stopped
    requesting tools, mirroring ``StreamJsonAccumulator.finalize``
    (which drops already-executed tool_use blocks from the terminal CLI
    response so Stage 10 "sees no tool_use blocks and naturally
    no-ops"). Its usage is the SUM of every inner call's usage, so
    Stage 7 prices the whole turn; each inner call additionally emitted
    its own ``api.request`` / ``api.response`` pair for per-call
    attribution.

    Failure containment — the model reacts, the turn never dies:

    - permission DENY → the dispatcher returns a structured
      ``access_denied`` tool_result (``is_error=True``) after firing
      ``PERMISSION_DENIED``; the loop continues.
    - ASK → ``PERMISSION_REQUEST`` hook, then the bound HITL requester,
      then safe-deny — Stage 10's exact ladder, because it IS Stage
      10's ladder.
    - tool exceptions → structured error tool_result, never a raise.

    Caps (graceful degradation to the pipeline path): when
    ``max_inner_turns`` is reached or the per-turn cost budget
    (``state.total_cost_usd`` + this loop's inner cost vs
    ``state.cost_budget_usd`` — the same fields Stage 16's budget
    controllers read) is exceeded, the strategy emits
    ``api.internal_loop_capped`` {turns, reason} and returns the last
    response AS-IS — unresolved tool_use blocks then flow to Stage 9/10
    like any pipeline-mode response, so a capped loop degrades into the
    default execution shape instead of dropping work.

    Capability guard (one-time warning, then pipeline behaviour):

    - subprocess backends (``capabilities.is_subprocess`` — the CLI
      already loops internally; looping again would re-dispatch tools
      the subprocess already executed);
    - clients without ``supports_tools`` (nothing to loop);
    - no ``state.tool_dispatcher`` (the pipeline has no Tool stage to
      share a dispatch path with).
