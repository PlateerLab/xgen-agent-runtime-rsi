    Two execution shapes exist for "the model wants tools" (2.3.0):

    - **pipeline** — the stage makes exactly one client call and returns
      the response verbatim, tool_use blocks included. Stage 9 parses
      them, Stage 10 dispatches, Stage 16 loops the whole pipeline.
      Full per-round-trip stage control (guards, token tracking,
      review, evaluation) at the cost of re-running every stage per
      tool round-trip.
    - **internal** — the strategy resolves tool calls *inside* Stage 6
      (call → dispatch → call …) and returns only the final response,
      mirroring how the ``claude_code_cli`` backend's subprocess loop
      already behaves (see ``StreamJsonAccumulator.finalize``).

    The strategy never talks to the client directly — it drives the
    stage-built :data:`ToolLoopCall` closure so every call shares the
    stage's retry strategy, timeout plumbing, stream handling and
    ``api.request``/``api.response``/``api.error`` event contract.
