    Stage 6's :meth:`Stage.resolve_model_config` picks it up. Pure
    function of state; planners must not mutate anything other than
    reading state and returning the new budget.

    wiring the slot is safe even when no real adaptive logic is plugged
    in. :class:`AdaptiveThinkingBudget` (also in this artifact) sizes
    the budget based on cheap heuristics: tool advertising, message
    size, recent reflection signals.
