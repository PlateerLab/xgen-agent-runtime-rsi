"""PersonaProvider Protocol + PersonaResolution dataclass.

Cycle 20260424 executor uplift — Phase 7 Sprint S7.1.

A PersonaProvider produces a fresh :class:`PersonaResolution` on every
turn. The :class:`DynamicPersonaPromptBuilder` calls
``provider.resolve(state, session_meta=...)`` from inside Stage 3's
build path and weaves the returned blocks into the system prompt.

``resolve`` is **synchronous** by contract — Stage 3's
``execute → builder.build`` chain is sync, so smuggling async through
that boundary would require an event-loop hack. All provider-side I/O
(character markdown reads, DB lookups, persona graph queries) should
be cached at provider construction time or memoised on first use.

Implementations must be safe for concurrent sessions — typically by
keying any mutable state on ``session_meta["session_id"]``.
