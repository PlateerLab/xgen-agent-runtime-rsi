       ``token`` (via ``pipeline._pending_hitl``),

       cannot leak Future objects.

    receiving the human's verdict) then calls
    ``pipeline.resume(token, decision)`` to satisfy the future. The

    alive for the duration of the run; pipelines released after the
    run completes will GC normally.
