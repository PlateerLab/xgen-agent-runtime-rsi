"""PlatformAdapter ABC — one inbound/outbound chat platform connection.

An adapter owns the *transport* for a platform: how to fetch new inbound
messages and how to send a reply. It owns no agent logic — the
:class:`~xgen_rsi.base.gateway.runner.GatewayRunner` drives the loop and calls
the host's handler. Keeping adapters transport-only is what lets the executor
ship them built-in while the host stays "just a user".
