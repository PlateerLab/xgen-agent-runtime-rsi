"""Inbound chat gateway — receive messages from chat platforms, run an agent
turn, reply.

Built-in: the executor owns the gateway framework + platform adapters —
**Telegram** (HTTP long-poll), **Discord** (Gateway WebSocket), and **Slack**
(Socket Mode WebSocket), none needing a public endpoint. A host declares
platforms in config and supplies a handler (``message in → reply text out``);
it ships no transport code. Run :class:`GatewayRunner` from the app lifespan.

    from xgen_rsi.base.gateway import build_gateway

    async def handler(msg):                 # msg: InboundMessage
        return await run_my_agent(msg.chat_id, msg.text)   # -> reply str

    runner = build_gateway(
        [{"platform": "telegram", "config": {"token": "123:abc"}}],
        handler,
    )
    await runner.start()
    ...
    await runner.shutdown()
