      ``check_permissions`` fallback gets a say). This is the 2.x
      default purely for back-compat: both production hosts were built
      against allow-by-default and a silent flip would break them.
    - ``DENY`` — unmatched invocations are refused. With no rules
      bound at all, DENY means "deny everything except an explicit
      allowlist" — the matrix is consulted even for an empty rule set.

    .. warning:: The philosophy target is **deny-by-default**
       ("policy via config, not hardcode" — the declared posture of
       this library). 3.0 flips the default to ``DENY``; hosts should
       set the posture explicitly today so the flip is a no-op for
       them. Until then the default stays ``ALLOW`` because 2.2.0 is
       a minor release and may not change runtime behaviour under
