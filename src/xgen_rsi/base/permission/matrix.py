"""Permission matrix evaluation — the single entry point.

Usage (from Stage 4 Guard or Stage 10 Tool orchestrator):

    decision = await evaluate_permission(
        tool=my_tool,
        tool_input=input_dict,
        rules=session_rules,
        mode=session.permission_mode,
        default_posture=PermissionPosture.DENY,
    )
    if decision.behavior is PermissionBehavior.DENY:
        ...

Posture (2.2.0, audit §1-5 "policy via config, not hardcode"):
the matrix is **allow-by-default** when no rule matches — a 2.x
back-compat artifact, not the design intent. The configurable
``default_posture`` parameter is the migration path: hosts set it to
``DENY`` to get "deny everything except an explicit allowlist" today.
**The philosophy target is deny-by-default and 3.0 flips the
default** — new integrations should pass ``DENY`` explicitly now so
the flip never surprises them.

    Resolution order:
        1. ``BYPASS`` mode → always allow (even over deny rules and a
           DENY posture — it is the developer escape hatch and beats
           everything by design).
        2. Walk rules in source-priority order; first match decides.
        3. ``PLAN`` mode + destructive → escalate to ASK (runs after
           the rule walk so an explicit ALLOW still wins; ASK is more
           conservative than allow and gives HITL a chance, so it also
           takes precedence over the posture).
        4. ``default_posture`` is ``DENY`` → deny. The tool's own
           ``check_permissions`` fallback is deliberately NOT consulted
           here: under deny-by-default only *operator-declared* allow
           rules may open the gate — a tool vouching for itself is not
           an allowlist entry.
        5. Fall back to the tool's ``check_permissions`` callback if
           provided (passed through as ``fallback``).
        6. Default allow (the ``ALLOW`` posture, 2.x back-compat).

    Args:
        tool: Object exposing ``name`` and ``prepare_permission_matcher``.
        tool_input: Validated input payload.
        rules: Rule set collected from all sources. Already-loaded order
            doesn't matter — this function re-sorts by source priority.
        mode: Session permission mode.
        capabilities_destructive: ``True`` when the tool reported
            ``ToolCapabilities.destructive`` for this input. Used to
            implement the PLAN-mode auto-escalation above.
        fallback: Optional async callback the caller may pass to wire in
            the tool's own ``check_permissions``. Kept as a parameter
            (rather than importing Tool directly) to avoid a circular
            dependency.
        default_posture: What happens when no rule matches (2.2.0).
            ``ALLOW`` (default, back-compat) preserves the historical
            behaviour. ``DENY`` refuses unmatched invocations — combined
            with an empty rule set this is "deny everything except an
            explicit allowlist". The 3.0 default flips to ``DENY``; see
            :class:`~xgen_rsi.base.permission.types.PermissionPosture`.
