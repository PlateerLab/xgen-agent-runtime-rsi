"""Delivery channels — files / messages / events.

The framework ships the ABCs *and*, as of 2.10.0, built-in HTTP transports
(webhook / telegram / discord / slack / ntfy) so a host only supplies config.
Build them from config dicts with :func:`build_channel_registry`; the agent's
``SendMessage`` tool dispatches to them by name. Every transport is a plain
HTTP POST over ``httpx`` — no vendor SDKs, no extra deps.
