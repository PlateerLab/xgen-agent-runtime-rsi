"""Hook event taxonomy and payload schema.

The event kinds cover session lifecycle, each stage's enter/exit,
tool invocation boundaries, permission decisions, and notification
channels. :class:`~xgen_rsi.base.hooks.runner.HookRunner` dispatches
hooks matching these event names.

Taxonomy honesty (2.2.0, audit 2026-06-09 §3.5): the enum declares
the *full intended* taxonomy, but the engine only emits a subset
today — binding a handler to a reserved event is a silent no-op,
which cost both hosts dead-handler debugging time. ``FIRED_EVENTS``
below is the authoritative "what actually fires" set; consult it
before binding. Reserved members carry an explicit comment. The
pipeline-side wiring that will light up the lifecycle events is owned
by a separate workstream — do NOT grow ``FIRED_EVENTS`` without the
corresponding ``fire()`` call shipping in the same change.

Everything else in :class:`HookEvent` is reserved schema: the config
parser accepts it and the payload shape is stable, but no engine code
path calls ``HookRunner.fire`` with it — a handler bound there never
runs. The 2026-06-09 audit (§3.5) found hosts binding dead handlers
because the enum advertised 16 kinds while ~3 fired; this set is the
contract that keeps docs and reality in lockstep. A grep-driven test
(``tests/unit/test_hook_taxonomy.py``) fails the build when a new
fire-site ships without updating this set (or vice versa).

Fire-sites:
  - the tool-invocation trio fires from Stage 10's ``RegistryRouter``;
  - the permission pair fires from the same dispatch path when the
    permission matrix returns DENY / ASK (2.2.0, audit §1-5 ASK→HITL
    plumbing);
  - the pipeline-lifecycle five (PIPELINE_START / PIPELINE_END /
    STAGE_ENTER / STAGE_EXIT / LOOP_ITERATION_END) fire from
    ``Pipeline`` itself when a hook runner was attached via
    ``attach_runtime(hook_runner=...)`` (2.2.0 — previously the
    classic dead-handler kinds). They are observational: their
    outcomes cannot block execution, unlike the tool trio.
