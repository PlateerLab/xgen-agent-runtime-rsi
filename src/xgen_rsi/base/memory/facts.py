"""Structured Fact Ledger — durable conversational facts as first-class records.

The rollup tiers (:mod:`xgen_rsi.base.memory.rollup`) compress *narrative*;
this module owns the *atomic facts* a companion agent must never lose — the
user's name and how they want to be addressed, preferences, relationships,
commitments, long-running context. The two concerns are deliberately split:
a summary can degrade gracefully, a fact cannot.

Design contract (the reason this is robust where free-text memory is not):

* **The LLM judges, the schema constrains, the code stores.** Extraction is
  an LLM call whose output is schema-bound JSON (``FACT_EXTRACTION_SCHEMA``,
  enforced natively where the client supports structured output, validated
  in code regardless). What counts as "important" is entirely the model's
  judgment — there are no keyword lists here.
* **Diff semantics, never rewrite.** The extractor proposes ``upserts`` /
  ``supersedes``; :class:`FactLedger` applies them by key. Existing facts
  can only be *superseded* (kept, marked), never silently dropped — a bad
  extraction pass cannot erase the ledger.
* **Storage rides the notes infrastructure.** The ledger persists as one
  pinned ``critical`` note (``__facts__.md``): machine state in
  frontmatter, a deterministic human-readable rendering as the body. That
  buys always-on prompt injection (retriever L1.5 ``load_pinned``), search
  (``memory_search``), and host UI visibility with zero new plumbing.

Triggers are HOST-DRIVEN (same philosophy as ``MemoryRollup``): the host
calls :meth:`FactExtraction.run` on its idle/close cadence and supplies the
LLM as an async ``complete_structured(instruction, schema) -> dict | None``
callable. This module never does network I/O of its own.
