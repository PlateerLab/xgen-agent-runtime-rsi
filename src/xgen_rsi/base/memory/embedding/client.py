"""EmbeddingClient Protocol.

A provider-agnostic surface for turning text into dense vectors.
Mirrors the shape of Geny's embedding strategy without importing any
Geny code. The four concrete backends (`openai`, `voyage`, `google`,
`local`) conform to this Protocol and are dispatched by
`create_embedding_client` in `registry.py`.

The Protocol is deliberately minimal: one async method
(`embed(texts)`) plus a descriptor property. Batch size, retries, and
rate-limit handling are backend concerns; callers hand in a list and
get back a list.

Error contract (2.2.0, audit §2.6)
----------------------------------

`EmbeddingError` carries a ``category`` so callers can react
structurally instead of grepping messages. The categories mirror the
MCP boundary's NEEDS_AUTH FSM — the same package already solved this
problem once, and the live 401-spam incident showed what happens when
an embedding key goes bad without classification: every note write
re-attempted the call and logged a full traceback, forever.

    'auth'      — credentials rejected (401/403). Retrying with the
                  same key cannot succeed; the vector layer trips its
                  breaker after a few of these.
    'quota'     — rate limit / billing exhaustion (429). Retrying
                  *later* may succeed; never trips the breaker.
    'transient' — connection / timeout / 5xx. Retry-next-time is the
                  correct policy; never trips the breaker.
    'unknown'   — anything unclassified. Treated conservatively
                  (no breaker trip, traceback retained in logs).

    An httpx-based SDK client (``AsyncOpenAI``, ``genai.Client``) binds its
    transport/connection-pool to the event loop that first drives it and
    cannot be reused from another loop — a later call on a different loop
    raises ``RuntimeError: Event loop is closed`` / "Future attached to a
    different loop". Hosts that drive memory writes through a sync→async
    bridge (Geny's ``run_coro_sync``) spin a fresh, short-lived event loop
    **per call**, so a single cached client would (a) fail cross-loop on
    every bridged embed and (b), never being closed, leak its socket pool
    once per session.

    Strategy:
      * Cache ONE client on the loop that first uses it — almost always the
        stable server loop, where the vast majority of embeds happen
        (search, the memory stage). That loop's calls reuse it, so
        connection pooling is preserved.
      * If the cached client's loop is found dead, drop the reference (its
        transport is finalized by GC) and rebind to the current loop. An
        all-bridge caller (only ever ephemeral loops) therefore rebinds
        each call instead of accumulating clients.
      * Any OTHER still-live loop gets a short-lived client that the caller
        closes within the same call (``ephemeral=True``) — never drive one
        client's transport from two loops.

    Subclasses set ``self._client`` / ``self._client_loop`` /
