"""Tiered semantic memory compaction (rollup) — the compressed view a host serves first.

The executor keeps raw turns/events (STM) and structured notes; what was missing is a
*proper* semantic compression that is served first and lets the agent drill down. This
module builds that compressed tier:

    L1 rolling digest  →  STMHandle.write_summary()   (retriever L1, always injected)

from the raw STM the executor already keeps. It FOLDS the prior digest together with the
new raw turns into an updated digest (bounded size, history preserved in compressed
form), rather than re-summarizing from scratch or listing turns mechanically.

Design decisions (see Geny docs/analysis/memory-compression-pipeline.md):
  * Triggers are HOST-DRIVEN (idle / context-pressure / lazy) — this module never does
    network I/O on pipeline build. The host calls ``run()`` when appropriate.
  * Summarization is a host-injected async callable (the host owns model + transport).
    This module owns the ORCHESTRATION + the PRESERVATION-FOCUSED instruction, so every
    host gets the same thorough, important-info-preserving behavior. Cost is not
    optimized away: the instruction asks for a thorough, structured digest.
  * IMPORTANT INFO IS ALWAYS PRESERVED — the instruction names the categories that must
    never be dropped (facts, decisions, entities, user preferences/commitments, open
    threads, relationship/affect). Raw is never deleted here — only compressed.
