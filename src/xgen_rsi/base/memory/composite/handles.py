"""Composite-owned `CuratedHandle` / `GlobalHandle` wrappers.

The two non-required handles (`curated`, `global_`) are intentionally
kept off the native `FileMemoryProvider` / `SQLMemoryProvider` because
they are inherently *cross-scope* — a curated note belongs to a
specific user, a global note crosses every session — and a single-root
provider has no business knowing about other scopes.

`CompositeMemoryProvider` is the right place to attach them: the
composite already owns a `LayerRouting` table that can map
`Scope.USER` / `Scope.GLOBAL` to a dedicated underlying provider.
The wrappers in this module take that target provider's `NotesHandle`
plus its (optional) `VectorHandle` and pair them with the curated /
global semantics that the `CuratedHandle` / `GlobalHandle` Protocols
require.

Promotion is the only operation that needs to look at the *source*
side of the composite — copy a note from the session-scope provider
into the user-scope provider, then delete from the source. Both
handles share the same primitive (`_promote`), parameterised by the
target scope.
