"""Skill type system.

Cycle 20260424 executor uplift — Phase 4 Week 7 (Skills foundation).

A **Skill** is a code-free capability unit: a ``SKILL.md`` file with a
YAML frontmatter block and a markdown body. The frontmatter declares
metadata (name, description, model override, allowed tools, execution
mode); the body is the prompt the model sees when the skill is invoked.

This module defines the in-memory representation. Loading from disk
lives in :mod:`~xgen_rsi.base.skills.loader`; registration lives in
:mod:`~xgen_rsi.base.skills.registry`; the Tool wrapper that exposes
a skill to the LLM lives in :mod:`~xgen_rsi.base.skills.skill_tool`.

Design decisions:

* ``id`` is the unique identifier, derived from the skill's location
  on disk (``<parent-dir>/<skill-name>``) or set explicitly by bundled
  skills. Hosts that expose skills through the Tool surface see the
  id used as the tool name.
* ``allowed_tools`` is a tuple of tool names the skill may call. Empty
  tuple means "no restriction" — the skill inherits the parent agent's
  full tool roster. Non-empty means strict allowlist.
* ``execution_mode`` encodes how the host should run the skill:
  ``inline`` (same pipeline, shares state) or ``fork`` (spawn a
  subagent). Phase 4 ships inline; fork arrives with Phase 7.
* ``model_override`` lets a skill opt into a specific model (e.g. a
  Skill that does heavy reasoning picks opus even when the host
  session runs haiku). ``None`` means "inherit host".
* ``source`` records where the skill was loaded from — useful when
  audit / debug surfaces want to show "this skill came from
  ``/project/.skills/refactor/SKILL.md``" vs "shipped with the
  executor".

See ``executor_uplift/08_design_skills.md`` and
``executor_uplift/12_detailed_plan.md`` §4.

class SkillMetadata:
    """Metadata parsed from a SKILL.md frontmatter block.

    Only the fields the executor understands are surfaced here — any
    extra keys in the frontmatter go to :attr:`extras` so hosts /
    plugins can carry their own metadata without a schema change.

    Field requirements:
        * ``name`` — required. Human-readable label; not necessarily
          unique (multiple skill files can share a name if they live
          in different directories).
        * ``description`` — required. One-line summary shown to the
          LLM via the Tool description.
        * ``version`` — optional semver or arbitrary string.
        * ``allowed_tools`` — tuple of tool names. Empty = no
          restriction (inherit parent's tool roster).
        * ``model_override`` — canonical model id (e.g.
          ``"claude-opus-4-7"``) or ``None`` to inherit host.
        * ``execution_mode`` — ``"inline"`` or ``"fork"``.
        * ``category`` / ``effort`` / ``examples`` — discovery hints
          (PR-B.4.1).
        * ``arguments`` — declared argument names. Body uses
          ``${name}`` placeholders to interpolate them; missing names
          render as the empty string instead of leaking the literal
          ``${...}`` to the model. (Phase 10.1.)
        * ``argument_hint`` — short human-readable hint shown by CLI /
          slash-command autocomplete (e.g. ``"<file> [count]"``).
        * ``when_to_use`` — extra usage guidance for *model-side*
          discovery; surfaced separately from ``description`` so the
          short one-liner stays scannable while the longer rationale
          is available when the model is choosing whether to call the
          skill.
        * ``user_invocable`` — if False, the skill cannot be triggered
          via the user's slash-command interface (still callable by
          the model through ``SkillTool``). Defaults to True for
          on-disk skills; bridges (e.g. MCP prompts) can set False to
          keep them out of the slash-command palette.
        * ``disable_model_invocation`` — if True, the model cannot
          call the skill via ``SkillTool``; only user-driven slash
          commands fire it. Use for skills that *must* originate from
          the human in the loop (e.g. risky destructive workflows).
        * ``extras`` — every frontmatter key the executor doesn't own.
