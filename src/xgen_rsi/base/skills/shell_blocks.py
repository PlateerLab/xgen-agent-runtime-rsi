"""Shell-block execution for skill bodies.

Phase 10.3 (Skills uplift) — skills can embed shell commands directly
in their markdown body. The renderer parses two forms:

* **Fenced**::

      ```!
      git diff origin/main...HEAD
      ```

  Triple-backtick block opened with ``!`` (no language tag, the
  bang is the language marker). The whole inner text is fed to the
  configured shell. Multi-line scripts work fine.

* **Inline**::

      Use !`git rev-parse HEAD` to get the current commit.

  ``!`` followed by a single-backtick literal. One-line, intended for
  inline substitution like the example above.

Both forms are *replaced in the body* with the captured stdout (and
stderr if the command failed) before the rendered body is handed to
the LLM. The LLM never sees the raw `!`...`` ` syntax — only the
result text. This means the model does not need a separate Bash tool
call to learn what a skill knows about the host's state.

Security notes:

* Execution honours the skill's permission grants made by Phase 10.2
  (`SkillTool._grant_allowed_tools` adds ALLOW rules to the live
  ToolContext). The shell command runs as a single subprocess —
  Phase 10.2's grants don't gate the subprocess directly, but the
  *containing skill* has been deemed safe to run, and that skill
  documents the tools it'll touch.
* MCP-sourced skills are explicitly **stripped of shell blocks** by
  ``execute_blocks(..., trust_shell=False)`` — bodies coming from
  remote prompt servers are untrusted code paths. Hosts call
  ``trust_shell=False`` for any skill whose ``source_kind`` is MCP
  or otherwise untrusted.
* Each block has a per-skill wall-clock timeout (frontmatter
  ``shell_timeout_s``, default 30s).
* The skill's ``working_dir`` (from ``ToolContext.working_dir``) is
  the cwd. Empty / missing → process default cwd.
* ``ToolContext.env_vars`` is overlaid onto ``os.environ`` for the
  subprocess, so hosts that inject SECRETS for a session see them
  too.

Implementation is sync (subprocess) for simplicity. The skill's
overall execution path stays async; we run the subprocess in a
default executor when called from async code.
