"""Bundled skill loader — Phase 10.4.

The executor ships a small catalog of operational skills under
``xgen_rsi/base/skills/bundled/<id>/SKILL.md``. They're packaged with
the wheel (see ``pyproject.toml`` `tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel`
include rules) so installs always carry them; hosts that want a
lighter footprint can opt out by passing ``include_bundled=False``
to :func:`load_bundled_skills`.

Convention mirrors disk-loaded skills exactly — the bundled tree is
just another root passed to :func:`load_skills_dir`. This means hosts
can replace / extend the catalog by dropping their own SKILL.md files
into a higher-priority directory; the registry's first-wins policy
keeps the host's version live.
