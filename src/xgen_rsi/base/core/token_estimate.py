"""Cheap, single-source token estimation for context-budget decisions.

The Stage 2 *proactive* compaction trigger and the Stage 4 *reactive*
token-budget guard must share ONE notion of "how big is the next API
call" — otherwise compaction (which shrinks ``state.messages``) cannot
relieve a guard that measures something else. Before 2.5.0 the guard
read ``state.token_usage`` (session/turn-cumulative usage, which
compaction never lowers) and compared it against the per-call context
window, so a long tool-loop turn could trip the guard with no way for
compaction to help. This module is the shared estimator both stages now
use against ``state.context_window_budget``.

The estimate is deliberately rough (≈4 chars/token, the heuristic Stage 2
has always used) — it *gates compaction*, it does not bill. Image blocks
are counted at a flat per-image estimate rather than their base64 length:
a single 1568px screenshot is ~1.6k vision tokens but tens of thousands
of base64 characters, and counting the characters would trip compaction
on the first image.
