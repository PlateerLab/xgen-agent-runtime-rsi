"""Central catalogue of well-known keys for ``state.shared``.

Cycle 20260424 executor uplift — Phase 1 Week 2 Checkpoint 3.

``state.shared`` is a ``Dict[str, Any]`` — free-form by design so stages
and host plugins can stash arbitrary data. Without a convention two
unrelated components may collide on the same key.

This module provides:
- Canonical string constants for keys produced / consumed by executor
  core and officially-blessed host plugins (e.g. Geny's creature
  state). Use these instead of literal strings.
- Namespacing helper for third-party plugins: ``plugin_key("namespace",
  "key") → "plugin.namespace.key"``.

All constants are deliberately stable strings — renaming one is a
breaking change and requires a major bump.

See ``executor_uplift/09_design_extension_interface.md`` §4.
