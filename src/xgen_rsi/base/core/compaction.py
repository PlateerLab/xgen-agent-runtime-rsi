"""Shared compaction runner — one place that runs a compactor, emits a
uniform event, and persists the snapshot to a memory provider.

Both the Stage 2 proactive trigger (context near 80%) and the Stage 4
reactive token-budget guard (context near the hard ceiling) compact the
SAME ``state.messages`` with the SAME compactor instance. Centralising
"compact + record" here guarantees they log and persist identically, and
that the snapshot is never written twice (a host wrapper that records its
own snapshot sets ``compactor.persists_own_compaction = True``).
