"""Deterministic tool-output pruning — the no-LLM pass that runs BEFORE
summary compaction.

LLM summarization is expensive and lossy; a large share of context pressure
is mechanical redundancy that a deterministic pass can reclaim first:

* **Duplicate tool outputs** — the same file read five times keeps five full
  copies in history. Only the NEWEST copy carries information; older ones are
  rewritten to a one-line back-reference (hash-matched, exact).
* **Stale image payloads** — a base64 screenshot in an old tool result rides
  every subsequent request forever (and survives summary compaction whenever
  the compactor keeps that message verbatim).
* **Oversized stale outputs** — a 10k-char terminal dump from twenty turns ago
  is almost never load-bearing; the head plus an explicit trim marker is.

Invariants (why this is safe to run on any history):

* Message COUNT and ORDER never change — STM watermarks and compaction
  bookkeeping stay valid.
* ``tool_use`` blocks and every ``tool_use_id`` are untouched — pruning can
  never orphan a tool call (pair repair stays a no-op).
* Blocks are rewritten in place, never removed; only ``tool_result`` content
  and image blocks shrink.
* The newest ``protect_last`` messages are never touched — recent context is
  exactly what the model is working from.

Everything here is pure function + stdlib; no model, no network.

When this runs (4.35.0 — the cost trigger)
------------------------------------------

Until 4.35.0 this pass only ran *inside* compaction, and compaction only fires
at 80% of the model's context window. Measured on dev over 28 days: the window
is 200,000 (claude-sonnet-4-6) or 524,288 (qwen3.8-27b `max_model_len`), so the
thresholds were 160k / 419k — while the largest prompt any real turn ever built
was 135,487 tokens. **The prune therefore never ran once.**

That is a trigger bug, not a tuning one: the only trigger was *capacity* (don't
overflow the window), and there was none for *cost* (don't pay to resend the
same stale dump on every call). The bigger the window, the less it ever runs.

So Stage 2 also runs this pass on an absolute token threshold
(:data:`DEFAULT_PRUNE_OVER_TOKENS`), independent of the window. Evidence for the
default, same 28 days (turns with usage records, bench excluded):

* Turn input splits into prefix (per-call system+tools) and *history resent on
  every call*. History is 22% of input at 2–5 calls, 45% at 6–15, and **71–72%
  at 16+** — 66% overall. History grows ~2,000 tokens per call.
* At a 30,000-token threshold, **no turn with 5 or fewer calls is touched at
  all**, while 13 of the 14 turns with 8+ calls are. The number separates short
  turns from long ones without encoding anything about what the turns *did*.

The pass stays conservative by construction — only results older than the last
``protect_last`` messages, only ones over ``trim_over_chars``, head kept plus an
explicit marker — so a model that still needs the detail can re-read the source.
