    """Pipeline execution state — readable/writable by all stages.

    Lifecycle contract (2.2.0, audit 2026-06-09 §3.3)
    -------------------------------------------------
    A state object may serve a single ``run()`` (the "fresh state per
    turn" model — Geny) or be reused across many runs (the "long-lived
    state" model — GAPT). Both are supported. One *run* of the pipeline
    is one conversational **turn**; the agent loop may iterate many
    times inside that turn. Every field falls into exactly one of three
    lifetime classes, and :meth:`begin_turn` is the single place the
    per-turn class is reset — :meth:`Pipeline._init_state` calls it
    automatically when it detects a reused state, so hosts holding a
    state across turns get a clean turn boundary without doing anything.

    **Per-turn (reset by** :meth:`begin_turn` **):**
    ``iteration``, ``current_stage``, ``stage_history``,
    ``loop_decision``, ``completion_signal``, ``completion_detail``, and
    the private slice outcome backing ``run_status`` / ``resumable``,
    ``final_text``, ``final_output``, ``pending_tool_calls``,
    ``tool_results``,
    ``evaluation_score``, ``evaluation_feedback``, ``events``,
    ``turn_token_usage``, ``total_cost_usd``, ``last_api_response``.
    Earlier releases never reset these, so a long-lived state carried a
    prior turn's ``loop_decision="error"`` into the next turn's success
    verdict and accumulated ``iteration`` until MAX_ITERATIONS fired
    spuriously — the exact GAPT incident class this contract closes.
    ``events``/``stage_history`` reset per turn because unbounded growth
    was the audit complaint; ``run_stream`` re-emits everything live, so
    hosts that want a session-long event log already have one.

    **Sticky (survive across turns until the host changes them):**
    ``session_id``, ``pipeline_id``, ``system``, ``messages``,
    ``shared``, ``metadata``, ``memory_refs``, ``thinking_history``,
    ``cache_metrics``, ``llm_client``, ``credentials``,
    ``session_runtime``, ``tools``,
    ``tool_choice``, and every model/limit knob stomped by
    ``PipelineConfig.apply_to_state`` at each run start (``model``,
    ``max_tokens``, ``temperature``, …, ``max_iterations``,
    ``cost_budget_usd``). NOTE: earlier docstrings claimed ``shared``
    "resets to {} at the start of each run" — that reset never existed
    in code and hosts now rely on cross-turn persistence (e.g. Geny
    creature state), so the *documentation* was fixed, not the
    behaviour.

    **Session-cumulative (grow for the lifetime of the state object):**
    ``token_usage`` (sums every API call ever made on this state) and
    ``session_cost_usd`` (each turn's ``total_cost_usd`` is folded in at
    turn end). ``total_cost_usd`` itself is the PER-TURN accumulator —
    it is what ``cost_budget_usd`` guards (Stage 4 / Stage 16 / the
    pipeline's hard limit) compare against, so budgets bound a single
    turn, not the whole session. Use ``session_cost_usd`` for
    session-level spend reporting.

    Two free-form buckets are available for stage-authored data:

    - ``shared`` — cross-stage communication. Any stage may read and write.
      Persists across turns on a reused state (see lifetime table above).
      Keys are free-form strings; writers and readers cooperate by
      convention (see :class:`~xgen_rsi.base.core.shared_keys.SharedKeys`).
      Not an event channel — use :meth:`add_event` for that.
    - ``metadata`` — general scratch. Historically used for pipeline
      signals (``needs_reflection``, ``L0_tail``, ``cost_breakdown``) and
      backs :meth:`Stage.local_state`. New cross-stage data should prefer
      ``shared``; ``metadata`` remains for per-stage bookkeeping and legacy
      signals. Persists across turns.

    Within a single loop turn, stages run sequentially, so ``shared`` has one
    writer at a time. If a future cycle introduces parallel sub-stages,
    readers/writers of the same key will need to add explicit coordination.
