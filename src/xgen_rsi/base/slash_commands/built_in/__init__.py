"""Built-in slash commands (PR-A.2.2 / PR-A.2.3).

Importing this module registers each shipped command into the default
registry. Hosts that build a fresh registry (tests, multi-tenant
scenarios) call :func:`install_built_in_commands` against their own.

Categories:

* INTROSPECTION — read-only state queries
  (cost / status / help / memory / context).
* CONTROL — mutating operations
  (clear / cancel / compact / config / model / preset_info / tasks).
